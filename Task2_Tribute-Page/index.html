            <h1 class="title"> The Life of Irrfan Khan</h1>
            <p>7 January 1967: A star is born.</p>

            <p>Irrfan Khan (born Sahabzade Irfan Ali Khan; 7 January 1967 – 29 April 2020) also known simply as Irrfan,
                was an Indian actor who worked in Indian cinema as well as British and American films.Widely regarded as
                one of the finest actors in world cinema, Khan's career spanned over 30 years and earned him numerous
                accolades, including a National Film Award, an Asian Film Award, and six Filmfare Awards</p>

            <p>Khan made his film debut with a small role in Salaam Bombay! (1988), which was followed by years of
                struggle. He acted in a few Film and Television Institute of India student films such as Reconnaissance
                (1990), which was directed by Sandeep Chattopadhyay.
            </p>

            <p>After starring in the British film The
                Warrior (2001), he had his breakthrough with starring roles in the dramas Haasil (2003) and Maqbool
                (2004). He went on to gain critical acclaim for his roles in The Namesake (2006) for which he was
                nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male, Life in a... Metro (2007), and Paan
                Singh Tomar (2011).</p>

            <p>Khan was born on 7 January 1967 in Tonk, Rajasthan into a Muslim family of Pathani ancestry.
                Khan's mother, Saeeda Begum Khan was from Tonk, and his father, Yaseen Ali Khan, was from the Khajuriya
                village in Rajasthan's Tonk district, and they ran a tyre business. He spent his
                childhood in Tonk, and then Jaipur. Irrfan was good at cricket and was selected to play in the CK Nayudu
                Trophy for emerging players in the under-23 category, a tournament seen as a stepping stone to
                first-class cricket in India. However, he did not attend as he could not afford travel expenses.</p>

            <p>He showed interest in acting under the influence of his maternal uncle who himself was a theatre artist
                in Jodhpur. In Jaipur, Khan was introduced to noted theatre artists and did several stage
                performances in the city. Khan completed his MA in Jaipur before joining the National School of Drama
                (NSD) in New Delhi in 1984 to study acting.</p>

            <p>In 2009, he featured in the film Acid Factory. He appeared as an FBI agent in New York (2009),
                and opposite Natalie Portman as a Gujarati diamond merchant in the Mira Nair-directed segment of the
                twelve-part feature New York, I Love You. In 2010, he worked on the third season of the HBO series
                In Treatment, enacting the part of Sunil, who is finding it difficult to come to terms with his wife's
                death and loneliness after moving to the New York City borough of Brooklyn.</p>

            <p>In September 2015, he was appointed the brand ambassador for "Resurgent Rajasthan", a campaign by the
                state government of Rajasthan. He lent his voice to the light and sound show at the war memorial for
                the Indian army at Vidhan Sabha Road, Jaipur. The show portrayed the valour and courage of Rajasthani
                soldiers, and their historic and modern triumphs in battle.</p>

            <p>In 2012, he changed the spelling of his first name from "Irfan" to "Irrfan"; he said he liked the sound
                of the extra "r" in his name. He later dropped "Khan" from his name because according to a 2016
                interview, he wanted his work and not his lineage to define him</p>

            <p> In March 2018, Khan revealed via Twitter that he had been diagnosed with neuroendocrine cancer. He
                sought treatment in the UK for a year and returned to India in February 2019.
